# Photoshop Notes

### General

- don't keep too many tabs/files open, uses a lot of memory and slows down computer

### Opening Files

- **.png .jpg .dng .psd .tiff** all open in Photoshop
- sometimes Preview will open the files instead of PS so right click and click Open with PS

- \***\*Adobe Bridge\*\*** --> File --> Open in Bridge
- Content space has thumbnails for files (can change size of them at bottom of screen slider bar or click on a file and use [cmd +/-])
- Can Drag and Drop folders to navigate to it --> make it fav location
- For large screen preview of file
  - click on file
  - View menu
  - Full Screen Preview
  - to exit preview, click esc key
- **Filter** tab to select different file types, keywords, date added/created, etc.
- can use star ratings for your images (can also filter them this way)

- \***\*Camera Raw\*\***
- DNG is Adobe's raw standard file, supported by a lot of cameras including iPhones
- think of this as being a utility that is hosted either by Photoshop or by Bridge.
- can only open DNG, JPG and TIF files, does not support layers like PSD and PNG

#### Or

- highlight files
- go to **File** --> **Get Info** (CMD i)
- **Open With** dropdown menu
- select **Photoshop**
- Then click on **Change All**

### File Types

- **JPEG** is a compressed file format, it uses lossy compression in order to keep down the file size, and it's great for flat photographic images. JPEG files are always flat, no layers.

- **PNG** is also great for photographs as well as designs, does not apply lossy compression and it is very common on the web, and for mobile devices. PNG files can have translucency associated with them, but not really layers.

- **TIFF** is traditionally a print production format, owned by Adobe. TIFF files can contain layers, most people don't use them for that purpose

- **PSD** which stands for Photoshop Document and it is most commonly used for layered files. When you're saving your layered documents you want to use PSD.
